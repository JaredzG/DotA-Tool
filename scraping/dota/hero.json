    "description": "Muerta is a master of death who stalks the lands of life, corralling targets with fearsome Trickshots from an eternity of practice that defies the mortal mind. Her family are forever beyond the spirit veil, but her deal with Death allows her to briefly call on them — The Revenants — in times of want or need to smother her foes. Always ready to pick off unwary targets with her Spare Gunhand and Parting Shots, Muerta offers all of her victims Mercy, and some, are fortunate enough to also earn Grace — one gun to deliver the soul, and the other, to claim the soul. Muerta is at her most menacing when she sheds her corporeal form, Crossing the Veil of the Dead to strike her enemies with the ethereal fury of the damned."
